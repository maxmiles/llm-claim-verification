The abstract states that mTORC2 is a critical regulator of amino acid metabolism in cancer via phosphorylation of the cystine-glutamate antiporter xCT. It further explains that mTORC2 phosphorylates serine 26 at the cytosolic N terminus of xCT, inhibiting its activity. This suggests that mTORC2 does indeed regulate intracellular cysteine levels through xCT inhibition."
