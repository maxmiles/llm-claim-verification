The abstract indicates that PKC\u03b6 deficiency, or low levels of PKC\u03b6, promotes the metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells to utilize glutamine in the absence of glucose, which contributes to their survival and proliferation under nutrient stress conditions. This is in line with the claim that aPKCz (another name for PKC\u03b6) affects tumour enhancement by influencing glutamine metabolism. Furthermore, the abstract also mentions that the loss of PKC\u03b6 in mice results in enhanced intestinal tumorigenesis, which supports the claim that aPKCz causes tumour enhancement."
