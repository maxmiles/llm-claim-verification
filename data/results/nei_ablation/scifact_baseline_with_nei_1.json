It states that birth weight was positively associated with breast cancer risk in studies based on birth records and parental recall when the participants were children. It also mentions that relative to women who weighed 3.000-3.499 kg at birth, the risk was 1.12 in those who weighed > or = 4.000 kg. This suggests that women with a higher birth weight are indeed more likely to develop breast cancer later in life."

The abstract mentions that the majority of studies identified a positive link between birthweight and premenopausal breast cancer. It also provides a relative risk estimate for breast cancer comparing women with high birthweight to women with low birthweight. The mechanisms underlying this association likely include elevated levels of growth factors that may increase the number of susceptible stem cells in the mammary gland or initiate tumors through DNA mutations."

It states that PKC\u03b6 deficiency (or low levels of PKC\u03b6) promotes the ability of cancer cells to reprogram their metabolism to utilize glutamine in the absence of glucose, which is a key aspect of tumour enhancement. The abstract also mentions that the loss of PKC\u03b6 in mice results in enhanced intestinal tumorigenesis, and that patients with low levels of PKC\u03b6 have a poor prognosis. This suggests that PKC\u03b6 plays a role in suppressing tumour growth, and its absence or low levels can lead to tumour enhancement."

It further mentions that mTORC2 phosphorylates serine 26 at the cytosolic N terminus of xCT, inhibiting its activity. This inhibition of xCT by mTORC2 would regulate the intracellular levels of cysteine, as xCT is involved in the uptake of cystine (which is converted to cysteine in the cell) in exchange for glutamate."
