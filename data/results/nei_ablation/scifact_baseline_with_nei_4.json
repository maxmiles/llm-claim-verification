The abstract states that the majority of studies identified a positive link between birthweight and premenopausal breast cancer.

The abstract further discusses potential mechanisms underlying this association, including elevated levels of growth factors and loss of imprinting of growth hormone genes."

It further explains that mTORC2 phosphorylates serine 26 at the cytosolic N terminus of xCT, inhibiting its activity. This inhibition of xCT by mTORC2 would regulate the levels of cystine, an amino acid, within the cell. Therefore, the claim that mTORC2 regulates intracellular cystine levels through xCT inhibition is supported by the abstract."
