        "UNRELATED\n\nThe abstract discusses the use of a luciferase knockin mouse (p16(LUC)) to report the expression of p16(INK4a), a tumor suppressor and aging biomarker. It mentions that p16(INK4a) activation is a characteristic of all emerging cancers, making the p16(LUC) allele a sensitive, unbiased reporter of neoplastic transformation. However, it does not mention anything about p16INK4A accumulation being linked to an abnormal wound response caused by the microinvasive step of advanced Oral Potentially Malignant Lesions (OPMLs). Therefore, the abstract is unrelated to the claim."
