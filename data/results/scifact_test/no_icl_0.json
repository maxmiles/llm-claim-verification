Furthermore, it is mentioned that Myc sustains pluripotency through repression of the primitive endoderm master regulator GATA6, which further supports the claim."

It mentions that STAT3 directly regulates the expression of the Myc transcription factor, which is crucial for the self-renewal and maintenance of pluripotency in murine ES cells. It also states that maintained expression of stable Myc renders self-renewal and maintenance of pluripotency independent of LIF. This suggests that c-MYC (another name for the Myc transcription factor) is indeed important for maintaining the pluripotent state of pluripotent stem cells."
