        "SUPPORTS\n\nThe abstract supports the claim by stating that most studies have found a positive link between birthweight and premenopausal breast cancer. The relative risk estimate for breast cancer comparing women with high birthweight to women with low birthweight was 1.23, which indicates a higher risk. The abstract also discusses potential mechanisms for this association, such as elevated levels of growth factors and loss of imprinting of growth hormone genes."

This is evident from the line in the abstract that states \"Increased risk of breast cancer was noted with increased birthweight (relative risk [RR] 1.15 [95% CI 1.09-1.21])\". This directly supports the claim made."

The conclusion also supports the claim by suggesting that in utero exposures, such as higher birth weight, could affect the risk for development of breast cancer in adulthood."

The abstract states that \"PKC\u03b6 deficiency promotes the plasticity necessary for cancer cells to reprogram their metabolism to utilize glutamine through the serine biosynthetic pathway in the absence of glucose.\" This statement directly supports the claim that aPKCz affects glutamine metabolism. Additionally, the abstract also mentions that \"the loss of PKC\u03b6 in mice results in enhanced intestinal tumorigenesis,\" which supports the part of the claim that aPKCz affects tumour enhancement."

        "SUPPORTS\nThe abstract clearly states that mTORC2 is a critical regulator of amino acid metabolism in cancer via phosphorylation of the cystine-glutamate antiporter xCT. It further explains that mTORC2 phosphorylates serine 26 at the cytosolic N terminus of xCT, inhibiting its activity. This inhibition promotes glutamate secretion, cystine uptake, and incorporation into glutathione. This supports the claim that mTORC2 regulates intracellular cysteine levels through xCT inhibition."

It mentions that p16(INK4a) activation is a characteristic of all emerging cancers. However, the abstract does not mention anything about an abnormal wound response or Oral Potentially Malignant Lesions (OPMLs), which is the focus of the claim. Therefore, the abstract is unrelated to the claim."
