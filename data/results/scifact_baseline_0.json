        "SUPPORTS\n\nThe abstract provides evidence that supports the claim. It states that \"heavier birth weights were associated with increased breast cancer risk\" and provides odds ratios for different birth weight categories, all of which indicate an increased risk for breast cancer in women with higher birth weights."

        "SUPPORTS\n\nThe abstract supports the claim that aPKCz (PKC\u03b6 in the abstract) affects tumor enhancement by influencing glutamine metabolism. The abstract states that \"PKC\u03b6 deficiency promotes the plasticity necessary for cancer cells to reprogram their metabolism to utilize glutamine...in the absence of glucose.\" It also mentions that the loss of PKC\u03b6 results in enhanced intestinal tumorigenesis. This suggests that PKC\u03b6 plays a role in tumor suppression, and its absence allows for tumor growth, supporting the claim."

        "CONTRADICTS\n\nThe claim states that cSMAC formation enhances weak ligand signalling. However, the abstract contradicts this by stating that \"enhancing cSMAC formation reduced stimulatory capacity of the weak peptide.\" This suggests that cSMAC formation does not enhance, but rather reduces, the signalling of weak ligands."

        "UNRELATED\n\nThe abstract discusses the use of a luciferase knockin mouse (p16(LUC)) to monitor the expression of p16(INK4a), a tumor suppressor and aging biomarker. It mentions that p16(INK4a) activation is a characteristic of all emerging cancers. However, it does not mention anything about p16INK4A accumulation being linked to an abnormal wound response caused by the microinvasive step of advanced Oral Potentially Malignant Lesions (OPMLs). Therefore, the abstract is unrelated to the claim."
